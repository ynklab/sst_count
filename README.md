# Logical Inference for Counting on Semi-structured Tables

## Overview


## Usage

### Environment
- Linux (WSL; Ubuntu 20.04)
- Python 3.7 (venv)

### Preparation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install depccg==1.1.0
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
Because `depccg_en download` does not work (confirmed in May 2022), you may have to download from the [direct link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mxl1HU99iEQcUYhWhvkowbE4WOH0UKxv) for the depccg_en model and locate the proper directory.

### Experiment 1 (General)
```
python experiments/general_exp.py
```

### Experiment 2 (Running Time)
```
./experiments/time_exp.sh
```
